Flowers are followed by attractive seed pods (to 4\" long) which split open when ripe releasing silky-haired seeds easily carried by the wind. Flowers are very attractive to butterflies and hummingbirds as a nectar source. In addition, swamp milkweed is a food source for the larval stage of monarch butterflies.",

It is often found growing in ditches, bogs, swamps, marshes, wet pastures, and along the margins of lakes and rivers. It is infrequently found growing in tropical areas. Stems are usually solid, with the leaves typically reduced to bladeless basal sheathes. Insignificant, minute, yellowish-green to pale brown flowers bloom in one-sided clusters (many-flowered cymes) located on stem sides slightly below the stem tips. Flowers emerge in summer (July to September). Fruit is an obovoid capsule. Clumps provide vertical accent to moist garden areas. Although the stems appear from a distance as coarse and stiff, they are soft to the touch. Soft rush is considered to be a somewhat invasive weed in a number of locations.

Three-petaled flowers (to 1.5” diameter), accented by contrasting yellow stamens, are borne in terminal clusters (umbels) atop stiff stems. Flower color varies from rose-red to blue to deep purple. Multiple flower buds form in each cluster, but individual flowers open up only a few at a time, each for only one day, blooming in succession in a relatively short April-May bloom period.

Male catkins (brownish-yellow flowers) are slender, cylindrical and droop in clusters of 2-5 from near the branch tips to 2-4\" long. Female catkins (bright red flowers) are upright cylinders (to 1/4\" long) located at the twig tips in clusters of 2-5. Female flowers are pollinated by wind. Female catkins develop into 1-inch long fruiting cones (strobiles) to 3/4” long containing winged nutlets (seeds). Fruiting cones mature to dark brown in fall, with persistence into winter. Cones have woody scales and resemble small pine cones. Birds feed on the seed. Broad elliptic to obovate dull green leaves (2-4\" long) with serrulate margins are wedge-shaped at the base and pointed at the tip. Insignificant fall color. Root nodules fix nitrogen.",

This is a low-branched, small to medium sized deciduous tree that typically grows 20-40’ (less frequently to 75’) tall with a broad oval-rounded crown. Bright green palmate compound leaves emerge in spring, each with five spreading ovate-oblong leaflets to 3-6” long. Leaves mature to dark green in summer. Fall color is usually yellow, although foliage may develop interesting and attractive shades of orange and red in some years. Greenish-yellow flowers (to 1” long) appear in clusters in mid-spring (late April-May in St. Louis). Flowers are followed by the familiar fruit, which is a globular dehiscent capsule consisting of 1-2 buckeyes encased by a leathery light brown partitioned husk covered with warty spines. Fruit on the tree is interesting but not particularly ornamental. When ripe, each buckeye turns a handsome shiny dark mahogany brown with a light tan eye. Since colonial times, buckeyes have been carried by many school children and adults as good luck charms. Ohio is known as the Buckeye State and has adopted the buckeye as its State Tree. All parts of this tree, particularly the flowers, bark and twigs, emit an unpleasant odor when bruised, hence the sometimes common name of fetid buckeye.\n",

    "description": "Aesculus pavia, commonly called red buckeye, is a deciduous clump-forming shrub or small tree with an irregular rounded crown. It typically grows 10-20’ tall. Showy, erect, 4-10” long panicles of red to orange-red, narrow-tubular flowers appear in spring. Palmately compound, shiny, dark green leaves are attractive in spring and early summer, but usually begin to decline by August. Smooth, light brown, globular (1-2” diameter) seed capsules encase 1-3 shiny seeds called buckeyes that ripen in the fall. Seeds are poisonous and are avoided by most wildlife. Fall foliage color is unremarkable. Red buckeye is native to southeastern Missouri where it typically occurs in low rich wooded valleys, at bluff bases, on wooded slopes and along streams (Steyermark). Flowers are attractive to ruby-throated hummingbirds and bloom in St. Louis at about the same time that the hummingbirds return to the area in spring migration.\n ",

    "description": "Betula nigra, commonly called river birch, is a vigorous, fast-growing, medium-sized, Missouri native deciduous tree which occurs on floodplains, swampy bottomlands and along streams throughout the State. In cultivation, it can be trained as either a single trunk or multi-trunked tree. As a single trunk tree, it develops a pyramidal habit when young, but matures to a more rounded shape typically growing 40-70' tall. Multi-trunked trees form a more irregular crown and are generally considered to be the superior growth habit for this species. Salmon-pink to reddish brown bark exfoliates to reveal lighter inner bark. Leathery, diamond-shaped, medium to dark green leaves (1.5-3.5\" long) with doubly toothed margins turn yellow in fall. Monoecious flowers appear in drooping, brownish male catkins and smaller, upright, greenish female catkins.",

Common yarrow from Europe and Asia was originally introduced to America in colonial times, and has since naturalized throughout the U. S. primarily along roadsides, fields, waste areas and lawns. These species plants are noted for producing deeply-dissected, fern-like, aromatic, medium green foliage and tiny, long-lasting, white flowers that appear in dense, flattened, compound, corymb-like arrays (to 2-4” across) throughout the summer on stems typically rising 2-3’ tall. The flowers are attractive to butterflies and other insect pollinators. Foliage has a strong, somewhat spicy aroma that persists when used in dried arrangements. Species plants are uncommonly sold in commerce, however. It is the cultivars and hybrids of common yarrow, most of which have stronger stems, more upright habits and larger flowers, that have become popular flowering plants for ornamental gardens. Cultivars also extend the range of flower colors to include pinks, reds, creams, yellows and bicolor pastels.",

In Missouri it most often is found in the Ozark region in the southern and central part of the State (Steyermark). Flat-topped clusters (corymbs) of daisy-like flowers (3/4\" diameter) with yellow rays and yellow central disks bloom in spring (April-June) atop sparsely-leaved stems rising to 18\" tall. Flowering stems rise from a basal clump of serrate, rounded to spatulate leaves (to 2-4\" long) each of which tapers at the base into a long petiole. Upper stem leaves are much smaller, sessile and pinnately lobed. Synonymous with Senecio obovatus.",

Foliage turns golden with orange hues in fall, fading to light bronze in winter. Open, branching flower panicles appear on slender stems which rise well above the foliage clump in late summer to 30-36\" tall. Flowers have pink and brown coloration but are perhaps most noted for their unique and noticeable (some may say pungent) scent that has variously been described as resembling a combination of coriander, popcorn, honey, sunflower seeds, and melted wax.

In Missouri, it typically occurs in gravel and sand bars along streams, slough margins, wet meadows, thickets, open woods, prairies and glades primarily in the Ozark region of the state (Steyermark). This plant is noted for its narrow, willow-like leaves, large flowering heads and narrow, twisting, involucral bracts. It is an upright perennial that typically grows on stiff, leafy, nearly glabrous stems which grow to 3-5’ tall in cultivation, but to as much as 6’ tall in the wild. Linear to linear-lanceolate leaves (to 7” long) are usually glabrous. Composite flowers, each with fluffy, pink-purple disks (rays absent), bloom in loose, corymbose cymes from late summer into fall. Flowers give way to rusty seed clusters. The source of the common name for vernonias has been varyingly attributed to certain “iron-like” plant qualities including tough stems, rusty-tinged fading flowers and rusty colored seeds. Notwithstanding its toughness, the plant is, with the exception of its attractive flowers, a somewhat unexceptional ornamental. Flowers are very attractive to butterflies. The within species is synonymous with and formerly known as V. crinita.",

    "description": "Juniperus virginiana, commonly called Eastern red cedar, is native to Missouri where it typically occurs on limestone bluffs and glades, wood margins, fields, pastures and fence rows throughout the state except for the southeastern lowlands (Steyermark). It is a broadly conical, sometimes columnar, dense, evergreen conifer with horizontal branching that typically grows to 30-65’ tall. Gray to reddish-brown bark exfoliates in thin shreddy strips on mature trees. Trunks are often fluted at the base. Heartwood is reddish-brown and aromatic, and is commonly used for cedar chests. Dark blue green scale-like foliage. Foliage may turn brown-green in winter. Cultivars of this species often retain better foliage color in winter. This is a dioecious species (separate male and female trees). Female trees produce round, gray to blackish-green berry-like cones (1/4” diameter) that ripen in fall the first year. Berry-like cones are attractive to many birds.",
